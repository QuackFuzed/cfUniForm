cfUniForm is a library of custom tags and other related assets that is based upon the Uni-Form markup by Dragan Babic. 

cfUniForm delivers the best of both worlds:

1) Standards-compliant (XHTML Strict) form markup that is consistent across all common browsers.
2) Build your forms by writing ColdFusion, and not (x)HTML/CSS.
